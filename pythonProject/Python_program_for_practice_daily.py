Q3. Python program to find the given year is leap or not program.
Conditions:
1. A year that has 366 days is called a leap year.
2. A year can be checked whether a year is leap year or not by dividing the year by 4, 100 and 400
3. If the number is divisible by 4 but not by 100 then, it is a leap year.
4. Also, if a number is divisible by 4, 100 and 400 then, it is a leap year. otherwise the year is not a leap year.
